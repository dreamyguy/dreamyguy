Yo! 👋

I'm a husband, a [musician](https://open.spotify.com/artist/0EiGue54P0MDdLnwCZ1nQp?si=1kZFTDwQQfy0w0439F7i4A), an ex-yoga monk and also a technologist, among other things.

I'm fascinated by how technology can make our lives easier. When sophistication is high, it disappears into the kind of simplicity that we take for granted. I'm interested in shaping technology that makes me forget it exists. If I succeed, I've done my job.

User-friendly web interfaces and everything that make them possible is what interests me most. After several years cultivating that interest, I've leaned towards the frontend, though I do solve problems across the whole stack.

When I'm not writing code tailored to my client's needs, I spend my time sharpening my skills and testing new tech through personal projects. I'm a big fan of functional programming, test-driven development, automation and continuous integration/delivery.

_**Some of my personal favourites:**_

💾 🧮 🤯 [**Gitlogg**](https://github.com/dreamyguy/gitlogg) is my attempt at converting `git log` information to `JSON` format, so that it could be consumed beyond the `terminal`. I've used it to extract data from thousands of repos and solved every glitch I've found so far, with the kind help of generous and skilled programmers. I've combined `bash` and `javascript` to realise this project.

📊 👁 🧘 [**Gitinsight**](https://github.com/dreamyguy/gitinsight) was my take at putting **Gitlogg** to good use. This app has been re-written several times, as I grew into better solutions along the way.

I'm currently re-writting it again, this time using a _this-is-how-I-would-do-it_ `GraphQL` + `Apollo Client` implementation (without `Redux` nor `MongoDB`, which are used in the current implementation). I have not yet pushed my changes to remote, but am working on a [different repo](https://github.com/dreamyguy/gitinsight-ts) until it does at least as much the current implementation does.

👩‍💻 🚀 👨‍💻 [**create-some-app**](https://github.com/dreamyguy/create-some-app) is a highly configurable CLI-based scaffolder that helps you or your organisation scaffold applications programmatically or through a human-friendly prompt-dialog.

If you'd like to scaffold fully configured applications that share proven architecture, sensible configurations, coding standards, deployment routines and overall improved consistency among your organisation's projects, this is for you.

</a>

✅ 🌈 🙌 [**Validate Color**](https://github.com/dreamyguy/validate-color) is perhaps the package that offers the most when it comes to HTML color validation.

_**It has 0 dependencies**_, is extensively tested and has [16,836 weekly downloads](https://www.npmjs.com/package/validate-color) at the time of this writing.

It also sports a [demo page](https://dreamyguy.github.io/validate-color/) where you can test all possible color validations! 🌈

</a>

🤖 [**Figmatron2000**](https://github.com/dreamyguy/figmatron2000) began as a _proof-of-concept_, to determine how easy it would be to export **design tokens** out of **Figma** to an application - _programmatically_.

It turned out to be quite straight forward, thanks to the great `API` provided by the folks at **Figma**.

As with anything elegant, it does require certain standards and ways of defining things, but once those are set, one can edit or create a color in the color pallette in **Figma**, name it to taste and it will be imported into the project the next time the `npm run figmatron2000` command is run.

  <img width="350" align='right' src="https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/pin/?username=whatthefoo&repo=fork-me-on-github" />
</a>

🐙 [**fork-me-on-github**](https://github.com/whatthefoo/fork-me-on-github) is a [React component](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fork-me-on-github) based on the great work by **Tim Holman** on [github-corners](https://github.com/tholman/github-corners), with the benefit of further customisation.

As demonstrated on the [demo page](https://whatthefoo.github.io/fork-me-on-github/), one can pass the background & foreground colors, as well as a URL, as `props` to the component. It also supports a _**pride**_ mode, for fun.

</a>

🚀 🐹 🎉 [**React Emojis**](https://github.com/dreamyguy/react-emojis) is surely my _cutest_ project.

It doesn't solve hard problems, but puts a smile in your face. I use its [demo page](https://dreamyguy.github.io/react-emojis/) all the time to find and copy emojis to clipboard. The _demo page_ also let's you copy the emoji in several different ways: _"accessible emoji markup"_, _"unicode"_, etc.

  <img width="350" align='right' src="https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/pin/?username=dreamyguy&repo=moments" />
</a>

⏳ 🔮 ✨ [**Moments**](https://github.com/dreamyguy/moments) is this kind of app that is nearly useless, unless one has a very nerdy interest in knowing exactly how many `<insert time unit(s) here/>` you have lived, or when you will hit **7,777** days (_spoiler: you'll be 21 years old..._).

There's a discovery mode to help you find something amusing, and once you've found it, you can create a calendar event right from the app, and be notified as it happens, _to the second_!

Everything you set or choose is shareable with _'copy-url-to-clipboard'_ functionality. If you'd like to surprise your partner with how many hours you've been together, you're covered!
